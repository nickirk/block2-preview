It is also more convenient and efficient for model Hamiltonians like Hubbard and Heisenberg models, and non-standard quantum chemistry models with non-Hermitian or complex number integrals.\n",
        "\n",
        "In ``block2`` we support a few different symmetry modes. For fermionic models, if the Hamiltonian conserves the total spin $S$, the projected spin $S_z$, and the number of electrons $N$, we can label the states using quantum numbers $(N, S_z)$ or $(N, S)$ or simply $N$.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The symmetry group for $(N, S_z)$ is $\\mathrm{U(1)\\times U(1)}$, which is Abelian. This symmetry mode is activated using ``symm_type=SymmetryTypes.SZ``. We will first introduce the DMRG calculation using this symmetry since it is the most convenient choice.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. If we label states using $(N, S)$, the symmetry group is $\\mathrm{U(1)\\times SU(2)}$. SU(2) is a non-Abelian symmetry, which is slightly difficult to work with, but it can be two to four times faster than the ``SZ`` mode. This symmetry mode is activated using ``symm_type=SymmetryTypes.SU2``.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. If we label states using only $N$, we can remove the ``alpha`` and ``beta`` subscripts in the Hamiltonian, and the symmetry group is only $\\mathrm{U(1)}$. This symmetry mode is activated using ``symm_type=SymmetryTypes.SGF`` (general spin fermionic). Note that the fermion statistics is considered in this mode.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. If we label states using only $N$, we can also transform the Fermionic Hamiltonian to qubit Hamiltonian using JW transformation and then do DMRG on qubits without considering the fermion statistics. This symmetry mode is activated using ``symm_type=SymmetryTypes.SGB`` (general spin bosonic). This mode has the worst efficiency (most of the time the efficiency of ``SGF`` and ``SGB`` should be the same), but it may show a clearer connection to other JW-based methods.\n",
